#My Preparation Guide for CKAD Exam (2022)

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer Exam is for anyone who is interested to seek knowledge and experience about deploying applications to Kubernetes.
The certification is offered by The Linux Foundation - https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/
Here is my experience on the preparation and clearance of the Exam :)

Preparation Part - I (Learning the basics about K8s) :

If you are a newbie to Kubernetes, I would say take a foundational course to make yourself familiar with Kubernetes, its components and how does K8s (shorthand for Kubernetes) work !
Even I took a foundational course despite working in Kubernetes for one year !
There is an extremely good course authored and tutored by Mumshad Mannambeth, which I followed prior to the start of my prep for CKAD - https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-kubernetes/

Preparation Part - II (Prep for the CKAD Exam) :

The CKAD Exam has different sections for different concepts about K8s and each section holds a different weight/percentage. The details about the sections and its percentage can be found on the Linux Foundation Portal (https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/)
For the Exam Prep, I took another good course by the same tutor I mentioned above on Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/
This course has all the required lectures and labs for the knowledge and practice required to clear the exam. I would recommend visiting the labs at-least twice, once along with the lectures and once after the course has been completed. As by the time we finish the course the hands-on of the earlier concepts of the course might fade a bit :)

Practice, Practice, Practice :

There are Mock Tests and Lightining Labs at the End of the course, which will give you an overall practice for the Real Exam. These practice tests come with the timer, so during practice you can give as many times as you feel to increase speed and build confidence !
Buying the CKAD Exam and Scheduling the Date :
The exam can be purchased on the Linux Foundation Portal, the link for which I shared above for the Course Description Part. The exam purchase doesn't mean you have to give the exam the same day. You can purchase the exam and schedule it anytime within one year of the purchase date, so book the date and slot when you feel you're ready!


D' Day - The CKAD Exam :

The CKAD Exam is fully online. As per the latest changes after June 2022, the exam environment involves installing a Remote Desktop Application and then logging in the environment to give the Exam. The logging in stage involve verifying your name and identity ( you might be required to show a Govt ID as proof). There will be a proctor assigned during the exam who might ask you give a virtual tour of your exam-place via the webcam. The exam-place should be clutter free, with no books/papers or anything which might be considered as a source of cheating. You can keep a clear glass of water or any bottle with no logo if you want.
The exam duration is 120 minutes and there are around 15–20 Subjective Questions. You need to have a good internet connection and remain your calm during the exam, that's the most important trick !

I faced quite many technical issues during my exam despite having a good internet. My exam window got logged out almost 4–5 times and on each resume I was required to re-verify my identity and the exam-place too, but somehow I just remained cool. After the 5th login, I even lost my Exam Timer, it was displaying a red bar with text "Exam Finished" though I was just 30 mins into my Exam time. Since I already kept a note on the time from my first login to the exam environment, I went on and attempted the questions as I could and passed the exam in the first take ( its not necessary to attempt all, you can do as per weightage of question).


Key Notes:

Practice Well. Practice using the imperative commands for creating resources in K8s as that would save a lot of time. 
A quick guide which I prepared for my notes which really helped me revist the commands too before exam have been shared in this repo - "Kubectl_Commands_For_CKAD.xlsx".

So, just remain cool, calm and give the exam only when you feel you have practiced well!

Happy Learning :)
